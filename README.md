# Flora
Flora is a project developed by students of UFPE (Federal University of 
Pernambuco) during the "Project Development" (Projet√£o) class, which is 
now archived. Flora consists of an ESP32 embedded vase system with
sensors (sunlight, humidity, and temperature) powered by a battery.
There is also a pump and water tank attached to irrigate the vase when
needed. This repository contains the front-end implementation of the
following pages: landing page, chat page, store, register, login and 
logout screens.
